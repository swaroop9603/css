		Appy Fizz is a sparkling drink that describes itself as 'the champagne of fruit drinks'. The new Appy Fizz website was part of a more extensive rebranding project by NYC-based design firm Sagmeister & Walsh(opens in new tab). As the creators explain in their case study, the identity "visualises carbonated bubbles through a dynamic graphic language of 3D spheres and circles."
